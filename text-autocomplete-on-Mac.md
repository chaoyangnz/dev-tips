If you are like me struggling to type correct words.

Normally, you can press `Option-Escape` or `F5`, OSX will autocomplete the word for you. 

It should word in Notes, Text Editor, MWeb, address bar and search bar of Browsers.


> Any app that makes use of OS X's built-in text editing system (NSTextView?) can take advantage of the completion feature (not just TextEdit). For example, I regularly use it in iChat, Yojimbo, and OmniFocus (although, in OmniFocus you'll need to either use F5 as the completion key (Option-Escape might also work, not sure) or use a hidden default to change the default meaning of the Escape key in OF).
