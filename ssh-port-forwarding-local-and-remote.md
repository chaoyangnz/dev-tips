# Local port forwarding

This means you can access a remote port by local port.

`$ ssh -L local-port:remote-host:remote-port user@example.com`

## An example: access a database server which can be only accessible by local

```
$ ssh -L 54322:localhost:5432 user@my-database-server-ip
$ psql -h localhost -p 54322
```

Now you can access local 54322 port to access the remote Postgres server (listening to localhost:5432)

# Remote port forwarding

This means public network can access your local port.

`$ ssh -R remote-port:local-host:local-port user@example.com`

## An example: public network user access your web server located in LAN

`$ ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 user@example.com`

Now the public user can access the server's 80 port (example.com:80), further forwarding to your local 8080 port for response.

There is one more thing you need to do to enable this. 
SSH doesnâ€™t by default allow remote hosts to forwarded ports. 
To enable this open /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add the following line somewhere in that config file.

`GatewayPorts yes`

```
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
$ sudo service ssh restart
```
