In Cocoa applications (for instance, TextEdit) there used to be a completion functionality by which, 

- pressing the esc, or `⌥`+`esc` (apparently, it depends on Mac OS X versions), a list of possible completions for the word being typed appears. 
- In latest versions, up to El Capitan, it worked with just `esc`; 
- In macOS Sierra, apparently, it has been reverted to `⌥`+`esc`.

Mac OSX Siera, the shortcut is `F5` or `⌥`+`esc`
